Practice so far...

**1. Weighted grayscale image conversion**
- Luminosity method is used to adjust the color channel contributions to the grayscale image. I experimented with various weights. No significant change in appearance.

**2. Horizontal and Vertical image flipping**
- No built-in method used. Created loops to flip images both vertically and horizontally-
